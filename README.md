## Exercise: Text styling and formatting

**Instructions**:

* Change the headings' font family, use a fallback system and make them bold.
* Make the `<h1>` 3 times the size of the base font-size.
* Make the `<h3>` 1.5 times the size of the base font-size. Center this element.
* Make the `blockquote`'s text italic.
* Cross out the `<span>`.
* Make the `<em>`'s words all start with a capital letter.
* Make the `<strong>` element all capital and bold.
